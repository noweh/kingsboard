# King's Board project

Welcome to the King's Board project, a Laravel-based project using API Platform to handle chessboard-related operations. This API allows retrieving and manipulating a chessboard structure, determining move validity, and assigning colors to board positions based on team and opponent pieces.

## Features

 - **Retrieve board colors**: Get the current state of the chessboard with color-coded positions.
 - **Validate moves**: Check if a given move is within the board limits.
 - **Assign colors dynamically**: Colors are assigned based on opponent and team pieces.
 - **API Platform integration**: Provides an OpenAPI-compatible documentation

## API Documentation

The API is documented using OpenAPI and can be accessed via:
`http://localhost:8000/api/docs`

## Proof of Concept
Before implementing the full ChessBoard API, a lightweight PoC was created to validate the core mechanics. This minimal version consists of just a few lines of code and showcases how colors are dynamically assigned based on piece positions.
